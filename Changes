Revision history for Perl extension Class::Clone.

0.05  Sat Jan 21 12:41:00 2006
    - Support older versions of 'Exporter' by basing ourselves off of
      it instead of just pulling in it's "import" function.
      I did this to the actual package in 0.04, but forgot to do it
      to the unit tests as well. D'oh! I'm hoping now that this is fixed
      in the unit tests, we'll get a nice shiny PASS on ppm.activestate.com.

      separate from it's originator.
